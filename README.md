# News app

The app shows popular news on a variety of topics from [The Guardian API](http://open-platform.theguardian.com/access/) 
organized on a clean UI, providing the ability on item selection to open the article in a web browser. 
 
The app has a very basic code implementation which includes a manual network connection to the API, 
fetching and parsing JSON data converted and presented in ListActivity. 
The app does not include the use of external libraries.
